# CryptoClustering

# Goal: 
Using knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning, predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.  

# Repo Description: 
In this repo you will find a Crypto_Clustering.ipynb file that contains the code for the unsupervised learning assignment.  
You will also find a Resources folder that contains the crypto_market_data.csv file that was used for the this assignment.

Question: After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

Answer: By doing fewer features you are able to have more clearly defined clusters as seen between the two graphs. You no longer have a red cluster in between the blue cluster.
